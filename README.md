# FinalProject
- Rough Plan for program

- Game play
- 1.) Board is setup and ready to play (empty with no X or O preset)
- 2.) Each player takes turns, marking a slot of their choice
- 3.) Continues until one player makes a line across the board (row, column, or diagonal)

- Program:
- 1.) Focus on making the game playable for one person
          - Make sure the board is setup correctly
          - Read and store input from player
          - Update the board according to the input
          - After each input, check for win conditions (each row, column or diagonal)
          - Print out win and exit program
- 2.) Add another player (pretty similar but a bit more difficult)
          - Read and store input from 2 players
          - Update board according to the 2 different inputs
          - After each player's input, check for win condition (each row, column or diagonal)
          - Print out who won (or if they drawed) and exit program

- Elements of program:
          - Menu?
          - Instructions on how to play and use the game
          - Board
          - Prompts for the players to input
          - Prompts for errors
          - Win message (or draw)

- Test cases / errors
          - Slot is already occupied (whether by their own or the other player)
          - Input for slot is out of bounds (not 1-9) (whether it be ints or chars or strings)
          -
